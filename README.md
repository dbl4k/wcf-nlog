# wcf-nlog

A sample implementation of the fantastic nLog in a boilerplate WCF project.

Current features are:

* an inheritable base class with an instantiated NLog logger for manual logging control.
* a simple custom set of NLog BehaviorExtensionElement, ServiceBehavior and ErrorHandler that will catch unhandled exceptions.
* behaviour configuration in config.

Nothing too advanced here, more of a proof of concept.

Enjoy!
