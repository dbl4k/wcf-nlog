# wcf-nlog
a sample implementation of nlog in wcf (unhandled exceptions through behaviour extensions etc..)

This is a boilerplate WCF project with a ssimple Nlog implementation.

Current features are:

* an inheritable base class with an instantiated NLog logger for manual logging control.
* a simple custom set of NLog BehaviorExtensionElement, ServiceBehavior and ErrorHandler that will catch unhandled exceptions.

Nothing too advanced here, more of a proof of concept.

Enjoy!
